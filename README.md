# SSD app

- This is the unofficial app of Society of Software Developers (SSD)
- I created this app to keep a record of SSD's history
- [how i deployed the app](Expo.md)
- this uses the [ssd-api](https://github.com/ericnavar/ssd-api)

# Contributing

- This repository is open to PRs and new contributors
- I am willing to transfer ownership of this repository to [SSD](https://github.com/ufssd)

## Potential  for the future

- add eslint
- improve styling
- ensure that app is accessible
- remove inline styling
- remove hardcoded data and then remove data.ts
  - officers
  - upcoming meetings
  - meeting date/time/location
  - semesters in which SSD has recorded meetings
- add more details about SSD and what it does, how to get involved
- ensure that the app doesn't look like crap on Android (I've only tested on iOS)
- add visual indicator for when video catalog screen is loading
- Note: The video screens load data from AWS in kind of an inefficient way. I only made this app as a joke so maybe in the future we can just embed a YouTube video instead of loading videos from Cloudfront.
- Include links to presentations/other resources from the presentation?
